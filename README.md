# ANN-based Approach to RNA-Seq Cancer Classification

Cancer, claiming millions of lives yearly, demands improved early detection. This project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning, could revolutionize cancer diagnosis by analyzing gene expression data. Its ability to learn patterns holds the key to unlocking crucial cancer biomarkers, paving the way for earlier interventions and ultimately saving lives.

The dataset is obtained from an open-source repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/401/gene+expression+cancer+rna+seq.
